# Markdown Renderer

This website renders Markdown documents as webpages.

## Markdown documents

All the Markdown documents are stored in the `documents` directory.

New documents must be created in this folder.

### homepage.md

This will become the website's homepage. The program will exit if no `homepage.md` is found.
